A Python3 package for querying, ordering and downloading from the REST API provided by Natural Resources Canada's [Earth Observation Data Management System (EODMS)](https://www.eodms-sgdot.nrcan-rncan.gc.ca/index_en.jsp).

Heavily influenced by the utterly fantastic `sentinelsat` package: https://github.com/sentinelsat/sentinelsat

## Usage:

Full documentation and real-world example on [GitHub Pages](https://m9brady.github.io/eodms-api-client/)!

## Quickstart:

Create a new environment with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)

```console
conda create -n eodms-env eodms-api-client -c conda-forge
conda activate eodms-env
```

... or install with pip
> **Warning**
> Pip is not recommended
> - may clobber your existing Python environment
> - may be problematic with Windows+GDAL

```console
pip install eodms-api-client
```

### Use the CLI

Given a geojson file containing search geometry (Point, Line, Polygon), query - but do not order - the RCM collection for products in the last 24hrs and dump the results to a geojson file for inspection (`query_results.geojson`)

```console
eodms -c RCM -g query_aoi.geojson --dump-results
```

Same query as above, but this time submit an order for all products found by the query instead of saving a result file

```console
eodms -c RCM -g query_aoi.geojson --submit-order
```

After submitting an order, this package will return a list of Order IDs that users should take note of as these will be used to download the imagery once the order is complete:

```console
eodms -c RCM --order-id [integer Order ID]
```

If your order produced several Order IDs (e.g. more than 50 images ordered at once), you may wish to create a text file of line-separated Order IDs to feed to the package:

```console
eodms -c RCM --order-ids [path to text file containing integer Order IDs]
```

### Use interactively in a Python REPL

Repeating the same query as the CLI example above in a Python REPL allows you to manually inspect the results and do all sorts of interesting things with the query result geodataframe. 

For example, one may wish to inspect the image metadata to check approximate download sizes. One may also want to inspect the image footprints to ensure that they are ordering only the images which have most-optimal coverage of their `query_aoi.geojson`.

```python
>>> from eodms_api_client import EodmsAPI
>>> x = EodmsAPI(collection='RCM')
>>> x.query(geometry='query_aoi.geojson')
>>> type(x.results)
geopandas.geodataframe.GeoDataFrame
```

## ToDo:

- [x] query RCM
- [x] query and order RCM
- [x] order with provided record Ids (no query necessary)
- [x] download given item Ids (no query or order submission necessary)
- [ ] blindly order (skip extra metadata fetching, just order whatever is returned by query)
- [x] add support for other collections:
  - [x] Radarsat2 (*WIP*)
  - [x] Radarsat1 (*WIP*)
  - [x] PlanetScope (*WIP*)
- [ ] add multi-select functionality for supported collection parameters
- [x] allow for collection-switching for an existing EodmsAPI instance (must re-evaluate params and rebuild search_url)
- [x] readthedocs documentation
